"""Torch-MLIR gap-op decompositions.

torch-mlir lowers hundreds of aten ops to linalg, but a handful have no converter
and torch-mlir marks them *illegal*, aborting the whole module. Several of these are
not even in the original graph -- torch's own decompositions introduce them (e.g.
``aten.empty_permuted``). The fix (not a monkeypatch): provide torch-level
decompositions that rewrite each gap op into ops torch-mlir *does* support, and feed
them into ``run_decompositions`` so the ExportedProgram handed to torch-mlir is free
of gap ops.

This is the growable registry: when torch-mlir reports a new "failed to legalize
operation 'torch.aten.<op>'", add a decomposition here.
